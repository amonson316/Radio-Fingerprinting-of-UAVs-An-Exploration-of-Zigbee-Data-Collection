Radio fingerprinting creates a way to uniquely identify devices based on small differences in the signal they transmit. Research has been completed in this area for IoT devices to determine the best way to translate this practice into a network security context. I was curious if it was possible, then, to utilize radio fingerprinting to identify signals from UAV devices. I was able to collect data from a UAV device with a Zigbee antenna, which supports the possibility that these devices could be identified using radio fingerprinting.
